# RaidGo - Pixelmon Side Mod

### üìù Licensing Notice

RaidGo is currently free to use.
The authentication system is already implemented, but it's currently disabled (it always returns true), meaning you can use the mod without any restrictions for now.

This is a temporary state while I finish developing the automated payment system (handled via a Discord bot). Once it's ready, authentication will be enforced, and the mod will only work for users who purchase or subscribe, according to the pricing listed on our Discord.

> üîí No payment will be required before 2026 at the earliest (could even be 2027 ‚Äî I'm kinda lazy about that üòÖ).  
> You're guaranteed free access until then.

If you're already using the mod, no worries ‚Äî you can continue using it normally. Any future changes will be announced well in advance.
